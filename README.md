                                                 Project Title:Excel Data Transformation and Interactive Dashboard Creation

In this Excel project, I undertook the task of transforming raw data into valuable insights through data cleaning, data preprocessing, and analysis. I used the features of Excel like PivotTables and PivotCharts to distill complex datasets into meaningful information. As a final result, I created an interactive dashboard that not only showcases the analysed data but also provides a user-friendly platform for dynamic exploration.

Please find blow the key steps involved in the Project:

1)Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

•	Data cleaning procedures were implemented to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
•	Data Preprocessing procedures were implemented to make the data ready for analysis. For example: A new column called ‘Age Group’ was created from data in ‘Age’ column using ‘IF’ function in excel where the people with age 30 or below were classified as ‘Teenagers’, people with age above 30 were classified as ‘Adults’ and age above 50 were classified as ‘Senior Citizens’. 
•	Also used “Vlookup” function in Excel to search and retrieve data to the table used for analysis from another table. 

2)PivotTable Analysis:

•	Utilized PivotTables to aggregate and summarize data, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of key trends and patterns.
•	Created multiple PivotTables to break down complex datasets into digestible components for targeted analysis.

3)Data Visualization with PivotCharts:

•	Developed dynamic PivotCharts like pie charts, Clustered Column-Line chart, Clustered Bar Chart, Clustered Column Chart, etc to visually represent key metrics and trends identified through PivotTable analysis.

4)Interactive Dashboard Design:

•	Integrated PivotTables and PivotCharts into an interactive dashboard, providing a centralized hub for data exploration.
•	Employed slicers features to enhance user experience.

5)Insights

•	Created an Insights tab which showcases the key findings/insights derived from the analysis/dashboard.
